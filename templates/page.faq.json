Our Shoe Care range, available online and at Hush Puppies retail stores will keep your shoes in the best condition.<br\/><br\/>In general, we recommend the following guidelines (If you have specific questions please email us).<br\/><br\/>Protect - We suggest using our Rain and Stain repellent to protect your leather, Suede and Nubuck from dirt and moisture.<br\/><br\/>Cleaning - Use our Cleaner and Conditioner to prolong the life of smooth, oiled leather. On a regular basis, brush away any surface dirt with a soft brush. After extended, rugged use, wash with mild soap and warm water. Be sure to rinse all soap off as it is hydrophilic. Our Tough Spot Remover can be used if you accidently get ink on your shoes.<br\/><br\/>Drying - Open footwear fully, remove the insole and laces and dry at room temperature. Never expose to heat!<br\/><br\/>Conditioning - Recommended treatment depends on construction and materials of the footwear (most treatments do alter colour and appearance).<br\/><br\/>Restore - Our Oiled Leather Sponge or Cream Polish will bring the shine on your shoes up to its very best. If your suede or nubuck shoes need restoring, our Suede and Nubuck Block and Brush Kit will do the trick.<\/p>"
